A lambda expression is a convenient way of defining
an often anonymous function object. Typically, lambdas
are used to write short functions that are passed into 
algorithms/other functions. 

As an example, let's consider sorting a vector of pairs in C++.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    for (auto &[first, second] : arr) {
        cin >> first >> second;
    }
    /**
     * Consider sorting the array of pairs in descending
     * order of first value, and then tiebreak by sorting in
     * ascending order of second element.
     */
    for (const auto [first, second] : arr) {
        std::cout << first << " " << second << "\n";
    }
}
```
{: file="main.cpp"}

What would the easiest way of doing this be? A solution without lambdas
would be to write a custom comparator function outside of `main()`.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

bool comp(const std::pair<int, int> &a, const std::pair<int, int> &b) {
    if (a.first == b.first) {
        return a.second < b.second;
    }
    return a.first > b.first;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    for (auto &[first, second] : arr) {
        std::cin >> first >> second;
    }
    /**
     * Consider sorting the array of pairs in descending
     * order of first value, and then tiebreak by sorting in
     * ascending order of second element.
     */
    std::sort(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), comp);
    for (const auto [first, second] : arr) {
        std::cout << first << " " << second << "\n";
    }
}
```
{: file="main.cpp"}

However, this is frankly quite verbose and pollutes our namespace just for 
a small function that we only need once. Hence, lambdas offer a cleaner alternative
to writing a separate function.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    for (auto &[first, second] : arr) {
        std::cin >> first >> second;
    }
    /**
     * Consider sorting the array of pairs in descending
     * order of first value, and then tiebreak by sorting in
     * ascending order of second element.
     */
    std::sort(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), 
        [](const std::pair<int, int> &a, const std::pair<int, int> &b) {
        if (a.first == b.first) {
            return a.second < b.second;
        }
        return a.first > b.first;
    });
    for (const auto [first, second] : arr) {
        std::cout << first << " " << second << "\n";
    }
}
```

Lambdas aren't limited to just writing anonymous functions though. You can
actually assign them to a variable, allowing then to act like regular functions.
The key difference that makes lambdas convenient is that lambdas can capture a specific
scope, making them very useful as smaller helper functions.

Just for the sake of demonstration, let's assume we want to make a function that
calculates the least common multiple of two numbers. This is equivalent to the following
expression:

$$
\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)}
$$

Let's assume we needed to find the LCM of two numbers many times, and that 
we aren't using `std::lcm` for some reason. In that case, we could use a lambda
to write our function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>

int main() {
    auto lcm = [&](int a, int b) -> int {
        return a * b / std::gcd(a, b);
    };
    std::cout << lcm(10, 10) << "\n"; // prints 10
}
```
{: file="main.cpp}

What if we wanted to write our own GCD method with a recursive function? Sadly,
there isn't a straightforward way to do this. The best way (in my opinion) is to use
something called a generic lambda.

The rough idea is that a lambda can't access itself in its function definition. So, to
fix this, we just pass the lambda into itself. Some code will probably help in understanding
what I mean by this.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto gcd = [](int a, int b, auto self) -> void {
        return b == 0 ? a : self(b, a % b, self);
    };
    std::cout << gcd(20, 30, gcd) << "\n"; // prints 10
}
```
{: file="main.cpp}

There are other ways to do this. One way is to use the `y_combinator` (no, not the 
startup accelerator) template.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

namespace std {

template <class Fun> class y_combinator_result {
    Fun fun_;

    public:
    template <class T>
    explicit y_combinator_result(T &&fun) : fun_(std::forward<T>(fun)) {}

    template <class... Args> decltype(auto) operator()(Args &&...args) {
      return fun_(std::ref(*this), std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    }
};

template <class Fun> decltype(auto) y_combinator(Fun &&fun) {
    return y_combinator_result<std::decay_t<Fun>>(std::forward<Fun>(fun));
}

}  // namespace std

int main() {
    std::cout << std::y_combinator([](auto gcd, int a, int b) -> int {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    })(20, 30) << "\n";  // prints 10
}
```

I personally don't like this method because it's verbose and doesn't have
any real benefit over the method described previously.

Another method is to use `std::function`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::function<int(int, int)> gcd = [&](int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    };
    std::cout << gcd(20, 30) << '\n';  // outputs 10
}
```
{: file="main.cpp}

This method, along with having no benefits compared to the first method,
is also the slowest. This is because of something called type erasure, which I won't get into.

# **Conclusion**

Lambdas are a convenient way to write anonymous functions, which is particularly useful for
passing functions into standard library algorithms. In addition, they provide an easy way to 
write helper functions without excessively adding new names into your project.

For competitive programmers, they may seem useless - especially using them to act as helper functions. 
However, I have personally found that they are the easiest way to keep my code nice and organized, making
debugging easier.
